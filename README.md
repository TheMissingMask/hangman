# Hangman

## this is a Python code to play a good ol' classic game of hangman

## a note on the files found in this repository

- there are the various **milestone_x.py** files which are sort of irrelevant but necessary to pass the checkpoints in the course
- the main complete code is in **hangman.py**
- this should be able to run internally provided you have the required Python modules:

    - random
      > pip install random
    - random_word
      > pip install random-word

To play, run:

    > python hangman.py

Then, when prompted, enter a single letter at a time.  If the letter is in the word, it's position will be shown.  If not, you lose a guess.  You have ten guesses total before the virtual stick person is hung. :|

### Enjoy!
