# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

It is a work in progress and at the moment just has a few options available, variable names that I do not like, and only takes one user input, but does check if there is only one letter and has a check against upper vs lower case user input
I intend to eventually rewrite this in the style of coding and variable names I like, but using the same basic workflow and overall approach; will also need to allow two words since sometimes hangman does have those

Annnnd now we have some other stuff including a function...some graphics would be nice
